    JavaScript, often accreciated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-time complied, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one od the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web allications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsets have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
